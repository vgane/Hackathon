            St. Anthony Foundation literally saved my life , I was blessed to have been welcomed into there recovery program when they had the Dairy Farm in Petaluma, I know down to my sole that without there recovery program and that wonderful farm ( so sad it had to be closed) I would be dead . I have the upmost respect and total gratitude for the complete Foundation, There meals are truly food for the sole. 
            thank you so much......

            The Dining Room at St. Anthony's is the center of social gravity in San Francisco's homeless and hungry community. Some clients sit and eat in silence, and many clearly enjoy an hour of cordiality with friends and volunteers. But for anyone missing a kitchen, or stocked cupboard, or any home at all in their life, the Dining Room is the Tenderloin's best place to come for daily nutrition, free clothes, resource news and a simple, dependable smile to reaffirm of our humanity. Deep thanks to all the staff and volunteers who improve several hundred lives--day after day.
